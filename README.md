DESCRIPTION-

Work Report Plan (WRP) for Spam Detection Assignment

Objective: Develop, implement, test, and document a predictive machine learning model using scikit-learn for spam email detection, delivered as a Jupyter Notebook.
Setup, Development, and Initial Testing

Goal: Establish the environment, implement the core model, and perform initial testing.
Tasks: 
oEnvironment Setup: Install Python, create a virtual environment (venv), install required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter), and configure VS Code with Python and Jupyter extensions.
oNotebook Development: Create spam_detection.ipynb, implement Cell 1-4 (imports, data loading, preprocessing with TF-IDF, model training with logistic regression), and debug environment issues.
oEvaluation and Visualization: Complete Cell 5-6 (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, feature importance plot) and test visualizations.
oFinalization: Implement Cell 7-8 (example predictions, model saving), run all cells, and document initial findings.
Activities: 
oReview assignment and set up project folder.
oTroubleshoot library installation and kernel configuration.
oCode and test the notebook incrementally.
oVerify outputs (metrics, plots, saved files).

Deliverables: 
oFunctional VS Code environment with all libraries.
oInitial working version of spam_detection.ipynb with trained model, evaluations, and saved files (spam_classifier_model.pkl, tfidf_vectorizer.pkl).
oDocumented issues and resolutions (e.g., in markdown cells).
Milestone: A runnable notebook with basic spam detection functionality by end of week.
Refinement, Optimization, and Documentation
Goal: Optimize the model, enhance the notebook, and prepare the final submission.
Tasks: 
oOptimization: Experiment with alternative models (e.g., Random Forest, Naive Bayes) or adjust TfidfVectorizer parameters. Add cross-validation for robustness.
oEnhancements: Improve visualizations (e.g., add labels, titles) and add error handling. Include markdown cells with detailed explanations.
oTesting and Debugging: Run the notebook end-to-end, test with additional emails, and fix bugs.
oSubmission Preparation: Export the notebook (e.g., as HTML/PDF), write a summary report, and finalize deliverables.
Activities: 
oTest and compare model performance.
oEnhance documentation and visuals.
oConduct peer review (if possible) and incorporate feedback.
oPackage and submit the assignment.

Deliverables: 
oOptimized and robust notebook with cross-validation results.
oWell-documented spam_detection.ipynb with enhanced visuals.
oFinal submission package (notebook, exported file, report, saved model files).
